# order-release

The front-end project aims to release an order that was stuck in the bank without the need for the user to access the bank to carry out the operation.

As access to the bank contains certain risks, this project came with the aim of facilitating the process of releasing a given order.

In this project, there is only the front-ent part, which was done in HTML, CSS and JS. The back-end part depends on how it's working for you.
